* SHA-1 implementation in C++

- Source code for SHA-1 is in sha-src
- All other folders are needed to build on the MBED platform for ARM core devices

** Warning

Do not use SHA-1 unless you have to! Although SHA-1 is not as broken as SHA-0 and MD5, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1#The_SHAppening][SHA-1 is generally considered weak]]. Use a hash function from the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2][SHA-2]] or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-3][SHA-3]] family instead.


** Build Instructions

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make test-sha1
```

Then flash the .bin file in `build/sha-src` to your MBED-enabled device using whichever method your device
datasheet recommends.
